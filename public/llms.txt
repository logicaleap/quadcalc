# QuadCalc — FPV Drone Build Planner

> An interactive web app for planning FPV drone builds with real component data, compatibility checking, and performance estimates.

QuadCalc helps FPV pilots plan their quadcopter builds by selecting from 1000+ real-world components across 13 categories: frame, motors, propellers, battery, flight controller, ESC, VTX, VTX antenna, camera, receiver, RX antenna, transmitter, and goggles.

## Features

- Interactive SVG wiring diagram showing component connections
- Real-time compatibility checking (16 rules covering mount patterns, voltage, protocols, connectors)
- Thrust-to-weight ratio calculation using real motor thrust data
- Estimated flight time based on battery capacity and motor draw
- Total cost and weight tracking
- AI build advisor (via OpenRouter) for component recommendations
- PWA support for offline use
- Dark and light themes
- URL sharing and local storage persistence

## Component Data

All presets use realistic specs from real FPV products. Key data fields:
- Cost in cents USD (e.g., 3999 = $39.99)
- Weight in grams
- Category-specific specs (KV, voltage, mount pattern, protocol, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia + Tailwind CSS v4
- No backend — fully client-side SPA
- AI features require an OpenRouter API key (user-provided, stored in localStorage)
